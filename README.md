## Appendix

**Implementation summary:**

- provided is a distance validation function that requests for the device location permission and if granted uses the [geodist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geodist) package to calculate the distance between the users coordinates and the assumed fixed constant

- Basic simulated user authentication
- Each component is modularized
- A custom Github workflow triggers eas-updates for the `production channel` and `production branch` on expo.binary production builds are also triggered from the same `main` branch as well
